<br><br>
<h5>Soil and Climate:</h5>
<p>Onion can be grown in all types of soils. Such as sandy loam, clay loam, silt loam and heavy soils. However, the best soil for successful onion cultivation is deep, friable loam and alluvial soils with good drainage, moisture holding capacity and sufficient organic matter. It is sensitive to high acidity and alkalinity and the ideal pH is 5.8 to 6.5</p>
<p>Onion is a temperate crop but can be grown under a wide range of climatic conditions such as temperate, tropical and subtropical climate. The optimum temperature for vegetative phase is 13-24°C and bulb development is 16-25°C.</p>
<h5>Cultivation</h5>
<p>Sowing time-</p>
<p>Kharif the first week of June, Rangda- the second week of July, Rabi - the second week of October</p>
<p>Planting time:</p>
<p>Kharif - the first week of August,
    Randga - the second week September, 
   Rabi - the second week of December.
   </p>
   <p><strong>Seeds:</strong>8 to 10 kg/hectare</p>
<p><strong>Planting distance: </strong>15 x 10 cm for Kharif and Rangda, and for Rabi summer-12.5 x 7.5 cm (plain rows)</p>
<p>Food formulations :Apply 20-25 tones of farmyard manure at the time of first ploughing so that it may get mixed thoroughly during subsequent ploughings,</p>
<h5>Maintenance :</h5>

<p>a) Weeding - every 8-10 days of regular intervals, b) Dose of a fertilisers after 1 month of plantation.</p>
<p><strong>*Water Management: </strong>Water every 8 to 10 days based on season and need of the crop.</p>
<p><strong>Companion crop: </strong>Carrots, Beets, Mint, Tomatoes, lettuce</p>
<p><strong>Plant Rotation:</strong>Plant after Beet, Potato, carrot and follow by cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli</p>

<h5>Yield:</h5>
<p>Kharif 15-20 tons per hectare<br>Rangda = 20-25 tons per hectare, Rabi: 25-30 tons per hectare.</p>
<h5>Integrated Pest and Disease Management :</h5>
<p>Reflective plastic silver colour and aluminium painted black mulches were effective in repelling the thrips in seed crop.</p>
<p>Two rows of maize or inner row of wheat and outer row of maize surrounding the onion plots.</p>

<h5>Post Harvest-</h5>
<p>Onions must be cured soon after harvest by placing them in a drying room at 20-30°C and 70% relative humidity for 12 to 24 h.</p>
<p>Exposure to light should not be there after curing as it will induce greening of the outer scales</p>
<p>Preharvest application of a sprout suppressant, such as maleic hydrazide, retards sprouting and prolongs storage life.</p>

<h5>Soil & Climate : </h5>
<p>light, fertile, loose and well drained acid soil (pH 5.0 to 7.0). Hard soil is not good for tubers. If you have a hard soil, then prepare your soil before planting by working organic matter in to the planting beds. Potato plants need lot of water and cannot tolerate drought. However, potatoes are very adaptable and will always produce respectable quality even if soil and climate condition is not ideal. (It requires favourable environmental conditions such as low temperature and short day conditions at the time of tuberization for rapid bulking rate.)</p>
<h5>Cultivation:</h5>
<p>Sowing time: Kharif June-July, Rabbi October - November</p>
<p>Seed varieties - kuphari chandramukhi, kuphari Jyoti</p>
<p>kuphari king, kuphari early, kuphari sindhuri Sowing rate : 20 to 25 q/ha (30 to 50 gm weight)</p>
<p>Tube formation happens at 15-20 degrees Celsius (65-70 degree Fahrenheit). Choose your cultivation time wisely as potatoes do not do well when temperature goes over 30 degrees Celsius. (90 degrees Fahrenheit) and may even die if it crosses 35 degree Celsius. (95 degrees Fahrenheit) If you are not using seeds, then cut your seeds such a way that every piece </p>
<p>has at least 2 tubers, and each piece is bigger than 1 inch. Cut potatoes 2 days in advance and let the side dry to prevent rotting once planted.</p>
<p>Planting: cut side down, 45 x 30 cm, apart from each other, eyes pointing up, 6-8 inches deep in soil.</p>
<p><strong>Food Formulations: </strong>spread and mix rotted manure or organic compost in the bottom of the soil bed. 250 500 q/ha of farmyard manure or compost during land preparation, preferably a fortnight before planting</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance:</strong>water the plant 2 times a week with 1-2 inches of water. Water well during flowering period. (furrow method is commonly followed) Keep hilling the plant as soon as it grows 6 inches tall to cover root loosely and support the plant. This will also protect the potatoes from getting sun bu. Potatoes are usually ready to harvest after 2-3 weeks after plants flower (90 to 110 days after planting). Harvest when soil is dry, do not wash them and store is cool dry place.</p>
<p><strong>Companion:</strong>Beans, Cabbage, Lettuce</p>
<p><strong>Plant rotation: </strong>plant after cabbage, cauliflower, and broccoli and follow it by cucumber, tomatoes, aubergine (eggplant), capsicum (peppers).</p>
<p><strong>Yield:</strong>20 to 25 ton per Ha.</p>
<h5>Post-Harvest –</h5>
<p>Always dry the harvested tuber quickly to remove excess moisture from the surface of tubers for improving their keeping quality.</p>
<p>Always dry the harvested tuber in storage shed, expose to sun causes the greening of potatoes.</p>
<p>Do not store the tubers immediately if they are exposed to rain after harvest.</p>
<p>Always follow the curing process at 25 degree centigrade with a 95 per cent relative humidity,</p>
<p>All the damaged and diseased tubers should be removed during sorting.</p>

<p>Ginger is grown for aromatic rhizomes which is used both as spice and medicine.</p>
<h5>Soil & Climate:</h5>
<p>Ginger thrives best in well drained sandy clay loam soil.</p>
<p>Being an exhaustive crop, it may not be desirable to grow ginger in the same field year after year.<br>The crop cannot withstand water logging and hence soils with good drainage are preferred for its cultivation.<br>Ginger grows in warm humid climate, can be grown both under rainfed and irrigated condition.<br>For successful cultivation it requires moderate rainfall at sowing time till the rhizomes sprout, fairly heavy and well distributed shower during growing period and dry weather for about a month before harvest.</p>

<h5>Cultivation</h5>
<p><strong>(a) Land preparation - </strong>Organic cultivation consist of minimum tillage practices.</p>
<p>Beds of 15 cm height, 1 m width and of convenient length may be prepared giving at least 50 cm spacing between beds.</p>
<p>Solarisation of the beds is beneficial in checking the multiplication of pest and disease causing organisms. The polythene sheets used for soil solarisation should be kept away safely after the work is completed</p>
<h5>(b) Cultural practices- </h5>
<p>An isolation distance of 25m wide is to be left on all around from the conventional farm. The produce from this isolation belt shall not be treated as organic.</p>
<p>Mulching the ginger beds with green leaves is an essential operation to enhance germination of seed rhizomes and to prevent washing off soil due to heavy rain.It also helps to add organic matter to the soil and conserve moisture during the later part of the cropping season.</p>
<p>The first mulching is to be done with green leaves @ 10 -12 t/ha at the time of planting. It is to be repeated @ 5 t/ha at 40th and 90th day after planting</p>
<p>Use of Lantana camara and Vitex negundo as mulch may reduce the infestation of shoot borer. Cow dung slurry or liquid manure may be poured on the bed after each mulching to enhance microbial activity and nutrient availability.</p>
<p>Proper drainage channels are to be provided in the inter rows to drain off stagnant water.</p>
<p>Being an annual crop, the conversion period required will be two years.</p>
<h5>Sowing Time:</h5>
<p>Apr-May in South India and little later in North India. Sowing by middle April in South India and first week of</p>
<p>May in North India give higher yield.</p>
<p>Seeds seed material from high yielding local varieties or preserved seed rhizomes free from infection of organically cultivated farms.</p>
<p>Seed rhizomes should not be treated with any chemicals.</p>
<p>Bits of seed rhizomes weighing 20-30gm each and having at least one bud are suitable for planting.</p>

<h5>Sowing Rate: </h5>
<p>600-1000 kg rhizomes/acre land</p>

<h5>Planting</h5>
<p>At the time of planting, apply 25 g powdered neem cake and mix well with the soil in each pit taken at a spacing of 20-25 cm within and between rows.</p>
<p>Seed rhizomes may be put in shallow pits and mixed with well rotten cattle manure or compost mixed with Trichoderma (10 g compost inoculated with Trichoderma).</p>
<p>Ginger rhizomes are plated in row 25 cm apart at distance of 20-25 cm with in row.</p>
<p>In case of irrigated crop, ridges are made 40-45cm apart and ginger planting is done in shallow pits on top of ridges at distance 24-30cm</p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <p><strong>Food Formulations:</strong>Ginger requires heavy manuring.</p>
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;                                  <p>Well rotten FYM @ 2.5 to 3 tonnes / acre as a basal doses in the pits.</p>
<p>neem cake @ 800 kg / acre</p>
<h5>Maintenance:</h5>
<p><strong>(a)Weed management- </strong>Two weedings.</p>
<p>The first weeding just before the second mulching and repeated depending on the intensity of weed growth.</p>
<p>The weeded material can be used for mulching. If necessary weeding is to be repeated a third time.</p>
<P>Plants are earthed up once or twice.</P>
<h5>(b)Water Management</h5>
<p>Proper drainage channels are to be provided in the inter rows to drain off stagnant water.</p>
<p>Irrigation at varying intervals of 5-10 days.</p>
<h5>Companion:</h5>
<p>Leguminous crop in rotation with ginger ex-Ginger-banana-legume or ginger-vegetable-legume</p>
<p>Intercropped with shade-giving plants, e.g banana, pigeon-pea, tree castor and cluster bean (guar).</p>
<p>As a mixed crop, in coconut, young coffee and orange plantations on the west coast.</p>
<p>At higher altitudes in Himachal Pradesh, ginger is intercropped with tomato and chilli.</p>
<p>Plant Rotation: Ginger is an exhaustive crop so avoiding it to be grown on same field and leguminous crop cultivation is good for the same land for reinstalling fertility.</p>
<h5>Yield:</h5>
<p>harvesting in about 8-10 months. The average yield ranging from 15 to 25 tonnes per hactare</p>
<p>mature leaves tu yellow and start drying up gradually.</p>
<p>The Clumps are lifted carefully with a spade or digging fork and rhizomes are separated from dried leaves, roots and adhering soil.</p>
<p>For making vegetable ginger, harvesting from the 6th month onwards.</p>
<p>The yield of dry ginger is 16-25 per cent of the fresh ginger.</p>
<h5>Integrated Pest and Disease Management:</h5>
<p>Shoot borer is the major pest infesting ginger. Regular field surveillance and adoption of phytosanitary measures are necessary for pest management. It appears during July -October period. Spot out the shoots infested by the borer and cut open the shoot and pick out the caterpillar and destroy them. Spray neem oil (0.5%) at fortnightly intervals if found necessary. Light traps will be useful in attracting and collecting the adult moths</p>
<p>Soft rot or rhizome rot is a major disease of ginger farming. While selecting the area for ginger cultivation care should be taken to see that the area is well drained as water stagnation pre disposes the plants to infection. Select seed rhizomes from disease free areas since this disease is seed boe. Solarisation of soil done at the time of bed preparation can reduce the fungus inoculum. However, if the disease is noticed, the affected clumps are to be removed carefully along with the soil surrounding the rhizome to reduce the spread. Trichoderma may be applied at the time of planting and subsequently if necessary. Restricted use of Bordeaux mixture (1%) in disease prone areas may be made to control it as spot application.</p>
<h5>Post- Harvest </h5>
<h5>Preservation of seed rhizomes:</h5>
<p>Healthy and disease-free clumps are marked in the field when the crop is 6-8 months old and still green.</p>
<p>Seed rhizomes are stored in pits of convenient size made inside the shed to protect from the sun and rain. Walls of the pits may be coated with cow dung paste.</p>
<p>Seed rhizomes are stored in these pits in layers along with well dried sand or saw dust (i.e. put one layer of seed rhizomes, then put 2 cm thick layer of sand or saw dust).</p>
<p>Sufficient gap is to be left at the top of the pits for adequate aeration.</p>
<p>The pits can be covered with wooden plank with one or two small holes for aeration.</p>
<p>Seed rhizomes in pits need inspection once in twenty days to remove shriveled and disease affected rhizomes.</p>
