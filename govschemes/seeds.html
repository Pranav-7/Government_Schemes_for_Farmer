        <h5>What to do?</h5>
        <hr>
        <p>Always use recommended variety of seeds as per local climate and adopt recommended seed rate and other package of practices.</p>
        <p>Replace seeds of wheat, paddy, barley, pulses (except arhar), oilseeds (except rapeseed, mustard and sunflower) once in three years, seeds of maize, bajra, jowar, arhar, rapeseed, mustard and sunflower once in two years and hybrid seeds every year.</p>
        <p>In order to get maximum benefit of the fertilizers, always apply in root zone instead of broadcasting.</p>
        <p>Always use treated seeds for sowing and test for quality parameters like purity, germination, free from weed seed etc. before sowing
        </p>
