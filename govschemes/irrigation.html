        <h5>What to do?</h5>
        <hr>
        <p>Conserve soil and water through Good Agricultural Practices.</p>
        <p>Harvest rain water through construction of check dams and ponds.</p>
        <p>Adopt crop diversification, seed production and nursery raising in water logged areas.
        </p>
        <p>Adopt drip and sprinkler irrigation system to save 30-37% water and enhance crop quality and productivity.
        </p>
        <h4>Pradhan Mantri Krishi Sinchai Yojana (PMKSY)
        </h4>
   <hr>
    <p>PMKSY was approved by the Cabinet Committee on Economic Affairs on 01.07.2015 with an outlay of Rs. 50,000 crore for a period of 5 years (2015-16 to 2019-20).</p>
    <p>The vision of PMKSY is to ensure access to some means of protective irrigation to all agricultural farms in the country - to produce ‘per drop more crop. Thus bringing much desired rural prosperity. PMKSY is strategized by focusing on end-to end solution in irrigation supply chain, viz. water sources, distribution network, efficient farm level applications, extension services on new technologies and information etc. based on comprehensive planning process at district/State level.
