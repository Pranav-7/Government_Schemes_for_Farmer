    <h4>Farmer Producer Organisations
    </h4><hr>
    <h6>How farmers can join FPO</h6>
    <p>A group of farmers who are actually involved in agricultural production and have a common interest in pursuing agribusiness activities can form a group in a village or a cluster of villages and apply for a registration of a Farmer Producer Company under the relevant Companies Act.</p>
   <h6>What Benefits farmers will get by forming FPO</h6>
    <p>As a cohesive group, farmers as members of the FPO will have better bargaining power which can be leveraged to buy or sell commodities at competitive prices.</p>
    <p>Aggregation of agricultural produce for better marketing opportunities. Trading in bulk saves farmers on associated expenditures like processing, storage, transportation etc</p>
    <p>FPOs may take up activities for value addition like sorting/grading, packaging, basic processing etc. which fetch a higher price for the farmers' produce</p>
    <p>FPO formation facilitates utilization of pre and post harvest infrastructure like green houses, mechanized farming, cold storage, agri-processing etc.</p>
    <p>FPO can expand its business activities by opening of input stores, custom centres etc. through which its member farmers can get subsidised inputs and services.</p>
    <h6>Contact details for applying for FPOs</h6>
    <p>Generally, FPOs are promoted under various Central Sector Schemes operated in the States by the Departments of Agriculture, Cooperation & Farmers Welfare. Farmers interested in forming an FPO may contact the Director of the concerned Department/Small Farmer Agri-business Consortium for further information (Email ID : sfac@nic.in ).</p>
    <p>SFAC is promoting 145 FPOs in 11 states of the country for value development of pulses and millets under NFSM. As per criteria of SFAC, an amount of Rs. 62.75 lakhs is provided per FPO for formulation, registration, training, capacity building, establishment of mini dal-mill & support to handling & market</p>
