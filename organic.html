            <h5>ORGANIC FARMING</h5>
            <p>Organic farming is a technique, which involves the cultivation of plants and rearing of animals in natural ways. This process involves the use of biological materials, avoiding synthetic substances to maintain soil fertility and ecological balance thereby minimizing pollution and wastage.</h3>

  <h4>Organic Farming:</h4>
  <p>India ranks first in number of organic farmers and ninth in terms of area under organic farming. Sikkim became the first State in the world to become fully organic and other States including Tripura and Uttarakhand have set similar targets.</p>
  <p>With the aim of assisting farmers to adopt organic farming and improve remunerations due to premium prices, two dedicated programs namely Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North East Region (MOVCD) and Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) were launched in 2015 to encourage chemical free farming.</p>
<p>About 40,000 clusters are being assisted under PKVY covering an area of about 7 lakh ha. MOVCD has brought in its fold 160 FPOs cultivating about 80,000 ha.

</p>
<br>
<h4>Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojna (PKVY):
</h4>
<p>"Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY)‚Äù a sub- component of Soil Health Management (SHM) scheme under National Mission of Sustainable Agriculture (NMSA) aims at development of models of excellence in organic farming through a mix of traditional wisdom and modern science in value chain mode to install sustainability, ensure long term soil fertility buildup, resource conservation and to offer safe and healthy food grown through organic practices without the use of agro- chemicals. PKVY also aims at empowering farmers through institutional development through clusters for not only in farm practices management, input production, quality assurance but also in value addition and direct marketing through innovative means. Participatory Guarantee System under PGS-India programme will be the key approach for quality assurance under the PKVY.

  </p>
  <br>
<h6>Organic Area Selection Criteria:
</h6>
<p>Organic farming under PKVY will be promoted preferably in hilly, tribal and rain-fed areas where utilization of chemical fertilizers and pesticides is less and the area has good accessibility for developing market linkages.</p>
<p>Cluster approach will be adopted in large patches of up to 1000 ha area.</p>
<p>Cluster chosen shall be in contiguous patch, as far as possible, may be extending over few adjacent villages (but not over large areas in sparsely distributed villages).</p>

<p>Formation of Gram Panchayat based Farmer Producer Organizations will be encouraged or already existing FPOs will be promoted under the scheme</p>

<p>The ceiling of subsidy a farmer is eligible will be for a maximum of one hectare. In a cluster, there should be at least 65% of small and marginal farmers. Women farmers/ SHGs should be given preference
</p>
<br>
<h6>What to do?
</h6>

<p>1.Promote Paramparagat Krishi Vikas Yojana (PKVY) for different crop/cropping system suitable to agroclimatic conditions.</p>
<p>2.In organic farming use more bio-chemicals, bio-pesticides and bio-fertilizers.

<h5>Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region
</h5><hr>
<p>North East India has traditionally been organic and the consumption of chemicals is far less than rest of the country</p>


<h5>Guidelines</h5>
<p>Realizing the potential of organic farming in the North Eastern Region of the country Ministry of Agriculture and Farmer Welfare has launched a Central Sector Scheme entitled "Mission Organic Value Chain Development for North Eastern Region" for implementation in the states of Arunachal Pradesh, Assam, Manipur, Meghalaya, Mizoram, Nagaland, Sikkim and Tripura, during the 12th plan period. The scheme aims at development of certified organic production in a value chain mode to link growers with consumers and to support the development of entire value chain starting from inputs, seeds, certification, the creation of facilities for collection, aggregation, processing marketing and brand building initiative.</p>

<h5>Mission Goals</h5>
<p>1.To create at least one to two replicable end- to-end organic value chain models in each of the state with the integration of growers, handlers,processors, and market facilitation agencies</p>
<p>2.To empower 30-50 thousand farmers of northeastern region through the creation of about 100 farmer producer companies and equip such companies with full value chain under its ownership.</p>
<p>3.To convert subsistence farming to commercial organic farming with end-to-end facilities.</p>
<p>4.To make Northeastern states as major suppliers of organic commodities for national and international markets.</p>
<p>5.To enable states to evolve their own brand.
</p>



<h5>Salient features</h5>
<p>1.Realising the potential of organic farming in North Eastern Region of the country Ministry of Agriculture and Farmers Welfare has launched this Central Sector Scheme.</p>
<p>2.Department promotes organic farming in North Eastern States</p>
<p>3.North Eastern States of India will develop as organic hub of India.</p>
<p>4.Farmers Interest Group (FIG)/ Farmers Producer Companies (FPCs) will be equipped with collection, aggregation, post harvest process and linking with market facilities</p>
<p>5.50,000 farmers will be benefitted through value chain production, processing, marketing and value chain support agencies.</p>
<p>6.To enable NE Region to evolve their own brand of organic produce.</p>
<p>7.Extremely rich Bio-diversity, valued options for wide range of crops to explore.</p>
