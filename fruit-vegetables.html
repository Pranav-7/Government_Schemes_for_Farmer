<p><strong>Soil & Climate: </strong>It is commonly cultivated in cool moist climate. The optimum soil temperature for seed germination is 22-26.20C and for growth is between 25.2 to 34.20C. It is grown in varied types of soils ranging from sandy loam to clay. It requires a pH ranging from 6 to 6.5 for higher production.</p>
<p><strong>Cultivation:</strong>Bring the soil to a fine tilth. Pits should be taken up at a spacing of 40 cm either way in hills Ridges and furrows are formed at 45 cm apart in plains</p>
<p><strong>Sowing Time: </strong>Hills- May-June, Plains-  August - November</p>

<p><strong>Soil & Climate: </strong>Cultivation of cauliflower is wide spread in many countries of the world. The optimum temperature for growth of young plants is around 230 C, but in later stages 17-200 C are most favorable. A fairly deep loamy soil is most desirable. It is sensitive to high acidity. The optimum soil pH for maximum production is 5.5-.6.</p>
<p><strong>Cultivation:</strong>Polyhouse may be utilized to provide favourable climate for germination of seeds and protection of seedlings from adverse weather condition. Four to six weeks old seedlings are transplanted in the field.</p>
<p><strong>Sowing Time: </strong>The sowing of seeds is done in May-June for early season, July-August for midseason and September October for late season varieties</p>
<p><strong>Seeds: </strong>The seeds of Cauliflower are sown in raised nursery-beds of sterilized soil. For early season crop the seeds should be treated with some mercurial fungicide to save the young seedlings from damping off.</p>
<p><strong>Sowing Rate: </strong>The seed rate is about 1 kg/ha for early varieties and 200 to 500 g/ha for late varieties.</p>
<p><strong>Planting Distance: </strong>Seedlings of early varieties are planted to 60 cm row to row and 30-45 cm plant to plant distance. The late varieties are planted at spacing of 60-75 cm between rows and 45-60 cm between plants.</p>
<strong>Food Formulations:</strong>
<p>150-200 q/ha of FYM along with N, P, K fertilizers @ 60 kg N, 80 kg P205, and 40 kg K20 per hectare should be applied before transplanting of cauliflower seedlings.</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance: </strong>Frequent shallow hoeing is practiced for the control of weeds Black plastic mulch is another effective method to control weeds, because it prevents light and restricts favorable conditions for the growth and germination of weeds.</p>
<p><strong>Water Management: </strong>First irrigation is given just after transplanting First irrigation is given just after transplanting. For early and mid season crop, usually. lesser number of irrigation is needed because of rains</p>
<p><strong>Companion:</strong>Basil, Bean, Dill, Garlic, Lettuce, Marigold, Mint, Onion.</p>
<p><strong>Plant Rotation: </strong>Plant after tomato/brinjal/potato and before pea/bean.</p>
<p><strong>Yield: </strong>Early maturing cultivars-80-120 q/ha, Main season cauliflower -150-200 q/ha.</p>
<p><strong>Cauliflower Pests and Problems: </strong>The control measures for insects, pests and diseases depend upon type and intensity of the problems. The control measures for the main pests and diseases are described below.</p>
<p>Cabbage Maggot:It attacks on the young rootlets and main root and causes wilting of plants. Application of suspension of Calomelis has been recommended as a control measure. </p>
<p>Damping off: It is a common disease in the nursery-beds of the early cauliflower. It is controlled by soil solarization using transparent plastic film or drenching the nursery beds with fungicide 3 to 4 weeks before sowing of seeds.</p>
<p>Downy Mildew: It is characterized by the appearance of purplish-brown spots on the lower side of the leaves. The causal organism is an obligate parasite, which is present in the soil. Sanitation and crop rotation help in reducing the infection of Downy mildew.</p>

<p><strong>Soil & Climate: </strong>Aubergine or Eggplant needs steady, warm growing conditions. Well-drained and fertile soil is preferred for the crop with pH between5.5-6.6. Eggplant performs best in daytime temperatures of 25-33 C and night time temperatures no lower than 20°C</p>
<p><strong>Sowing time: </strong>March-April Plantation time: April-May.</p>
<p><strong>Seed Rate: </strong>approx 300 to 500 grams/ Ha,</p>
<p><strong>Sowing Distance:</strong>90 x 75 cm</p>
<p><strong>Food formulations:</strong><br>25 tonnes of farm yard manure loosen the planting bed and mix in a 2-inch layer of rich compost made of cow-dunk fertilizer and then water well. in cool climates, cover the prepared bed with blac plastic film to help warm the soil. Allow 24 inches between plants</p>
<p><strong>Maintenance :</strong>Weeding after 15 to 20 days at regular intervals.</p>
<p><strong>Water Management: </strong>Irrigation is required at every third or 4th day during summer while in winter it should be at 10-15 days interval.</p>
<p><strong>Companion plant: </strong>Beans, Carrot, Fenugreek, Cabbage.</p>
<p><strong>Plant Rotation: </strong>After - Beet & Carrot and Before. Cauliflower & Broccoli</p>
<p><strong>Yield: </strong>30-40 ton per Ha.</p>
<h5>Integrated Pest and Disease Management:</h5>
<p>Nursery- two sprays of 4% neem liquid mix pesticides to the plant at an interval of 10 days.</p>
<p>After plantation-</p>
<p>1. Mix cow-dunk Compost or neem cake with the soil. 10 days after planting.</p>
<p>2. 10 pieces per acre of Pheromone (smell) traps.</p>
<p> 3. Get rid of the diseased tops.</p>
<p>4. 30 days after planting, spray about 4% neem of liquid mix pesticide every 10 days of interval.</p>
<p>5. While harvesting, get rid of the diseased fruits,</p>
